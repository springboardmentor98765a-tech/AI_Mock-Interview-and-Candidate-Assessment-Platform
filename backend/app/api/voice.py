Feature 9 — the real-time voice interviewer.

Why voice rather than a written test: the candidate must answer out loud, so
they cannot paste a question into a chatbot and read back the answer.

Questions are delivered as text — there is no text-to-speech. The candidate's
answer is kept as the recording the browser captured, which stays the primary
artefact: exactly what they said, in their own voice.

Module 5 then transcribes that recording and analyses it, and Module 6 scores
it against a fixed rubric off the same transcript. The transcript is stored
*alongside* the audio, never instead of it, so the machine's guess at what was
said can always be checked against the recording — and an outage in the
speech service costs the transcript and the score, never the answer.

Protocol (JSON text frames over a WebSocket):

    connect   ws://HOST/api/interviews/voice/{interview_id}?token=<JWT>

    server -> {"type":"ready","interview_id":1,"total":5,"answered":0,
               "skipped":0,"interview_type":"HR","domain":"...",
               "difficulty":"EASY"}

    client -> {"type":"next"}
    server -> {"type":"question","sequence_no":1,"category":"Introduction",
               "text":"..."}

    client -> {"type":"answer","audio_b64":"<base64>","mime_type":"audio/webm",
               "duration_seconds":42.5}
    server -> {"type":"recorded","sequence_no":1,"bytes":48213,
               "analysis_pending":true,"answered":1,"skipped":0,"total":5}
    server -> {"type":"analysis","sequence_no":1,"transcript":"...",
               "fillers":{...},"pace":{...},"communication":{...},
               "pronunciation":{...},
               "score":{"available":true,"communication":78,"confidence":65,
                        "technical_relevance":80,"professionalism":90,
                        "overall":76.5,"rating":"Good","rationale":"..."}}

`duration_seconds` is the browser's measured recording length. It is what pace
is computed from — see the column comment on answer_duration_seconds for why
the asked-to-answered interval will not do.

`recorded` is sent as soon as the audio is on disk; `analysis` follows seconds
later once transcription finishes. A client that ignores `analysis` still runs
a complete interview.

    client -> {"type":"pause"}       # stop the clock
    server -> {"type":"paused","interview_id":1,"total_paused_seconds":0}
    client -> {"type":"resume"}
    server -> {"type":"resumed","interview_id":1,"total_paused_seconds":94}

    client -> {"type":"skip"}        # pass on this one
    server -> {"type":"skipped","sequence_no":2,"attempted":false,
               "answered":1,"skipped":1,"total":5}
    server -> {"type":"question", ...}   # the next one, unprompted

    client -> {"type":"next"} ...    # until every question is done
    server -> {"type":"complete","interview_id":1,"answered":4,"skipped":1,
               "total":5,"score":{"available":true,"overall":76.5,
                                  "rating":"Good"}}

    errors -> {"type":"error","detail":"..."}

`score` on `complete`/`closed` is the interview's overall — the average of its
answered questions' scores (app.services.scoring), stamped onto
Interview.overall_score at the same moment. {"available":false} when nothing
was ever scored: analysis disabled, every provider call failed, or every
question was skipped.

A skip advances the interview on its own — the client does not send `next`
afterwards. Skipped questions are *not attempted*: they never count towards
`answered`, and they are not asked again.

While paused, `next`, `answer` and `skip` are refused: without that, a
candidate could read ahead on a stopped clock. `end` still works, so someone
who steps away and decides not to come back need not resume just to stop.
`end` sets a terminal status — it is a decision, not a disconnection.

Recordings are played back over the sibling REST route in interviews.py:
GET /api/interviews/{id}/answers/{sequence_no}/audio

Close codes: 4401 bad/missing token, 4404 interview not found, 4409 interview
has no questions.
