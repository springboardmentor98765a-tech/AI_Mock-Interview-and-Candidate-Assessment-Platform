"""
Analytics response shapes.

Every field here is a count, a list, a timestamp, a status, a duration, or —
now that Module 5 exists — a score read straight off Interview.overall_score.
Nothing here reports a figure the platform does not actually compute.

Module 6's figures stay out of the *aggregate* shapes here and out of the
leaderboard. They are measured in the candidate's own browser and are
therefore client-supplied, so ranking people on them would mean ranking on
something forgeable.

They do appear, filtered, on CandidateInterviewSummary — a recruiter
reviewing one session sees attention context beside the score. That is a
deliberate line: context while reading about a person, never a number that
sorts people. What gets filtered out (expression, emotion, the written
summary) and why is in behavior_analysis.recruiter_view.
