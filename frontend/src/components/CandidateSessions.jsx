 * "nervous" beside someone's name does not.
 *

 * it that way: low eye contact is reported as a number, never as a judgement.
 * Eye-contact norms differ by culture and by neurodivergence.

          These figures are uncalibrated estimates measured by the candidate&apos;s own browser,
          and are submitted by it — treat them as context, never as evidence. Eye-contact norms
          differ by culture and by neurodivergence: less eye contact is not worse interviewing.
          <strong> Confidence</strong> estimates how composed the candidate&apos;s face looked, not
          how confident they were: a calm face scores high whether or not the person felt calm, and
          an animated one scores lower without anything being wrong. Named emotion readings are not
          shown here, because a label beside someone&apos;s name outlives its caveat. None of this
          affects the score or the leaderboard.
